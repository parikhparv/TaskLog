# TaskLog

# About
TaskMaster is a simple, web-based task management application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add, edit, complete, and delete tasks in an interactive interface. The project was originally created as a final project for Harvard's CS50x, but has been developed into an app that demonstrates core web development concepts.

# Features

• Add tasks: Quickly create new tasks with a single input box and button

• Mark tasks complete: Toggle tasks as complete or incomplete with a simple click

• Edit tasks: Update tasks using a built-in edit feature

• Delete tasks: Remove tasks that are no longer needed

• Task counters: Keep track of completed and uncompleted tasks 

# How It Works

This app is powered entirely by front-end technologies—no backend or database is required. All interactivity is handled with JavaScript:

• index.html: Provides the structure of the app, including the input box, task list, and counters

• style.css: Handles the design, including task styling, colors, and hover effects

• script.js: Contains the functionality for adding, editing, completing, and deleting tasks, as well as updating counters
